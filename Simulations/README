Ths subfolders in this repository contains starting files for these simulations:

- Subfolders marked A1-*,A2-*,...,B3-* correspond to simulations described
  in Table 1 (Supp. Information), sections A and B; the number
  corresponds to the row of the table (e.g., A1 corresponds to
  simulations in row 1 of section A in Table 1), with either water
  model TIP4P-Ew or TIP4P-D.

  Spacifically
        A1-*: free FSFG-6 (125 residues)
        A2-*: free FSFG-2 (54 residues)
        B1-*: FSFG-6:NTF2 (125:250 residues)
        B2-*: FSFG-6:NTF2 (125:250 residues) with TAMD restraints
        B3-*: FSFG-2:NTF2 (54:250 residues)

- SlidingRAMD subfolder folder corresponds to the randomly-accelerated
  MD simulations described toward the end of the Results section.

- ExchangeTMD subfolder corresponds to the targeted MD simulations of
  exchange described toward the end of the Results section.
